<h3>What is your background?</h3><br>

<p>I started farming at the age of 13. I’ve been farming on-and-off for about 30 years.
My parents were college-educated folk from the urban East Coast, but they decided to move the rural West, a place called Sebastopol, to start living a simpler life.</p>

<p>My first early experience with farming was helping my dad with gardening and farming.</p><br>


<h3>Why did you become a farmer?</h3>
 <p>I believe that food should be a right but not a privilege of the few.</p>

<h3>What are the advantages women have on running farms:</h3>
<p>1. women tend to have a  more in a collaborative style<br>
2. women are not afraid of not being a expert, or to ask for advice or help<br>
3. women are ok to be a learner (don’t need to proved that they are experts)<br>
On the other hand: sometimes as a female farmer, she would run across a man who need to prove that he knows how things are done. Some men like to be bossy and show their expertise (even when nobody asks for). But a lot has to do with generations, older men tend to be more bossy; younger men recognize that women can do farm work
 
Most gratifying moment:
-teach adults/people to be farmers
-whatever she is doing, she is doing something to improve the future (a hope to the future)
make people feel empowered by the new knowledge (and healed?)

Recommendations for female who wants to become a farmer:
-don’t be afraid to try to do and learn it “typical male tasks: like repairs, ‘engineering’, mechanic works” things by yourself
-do not take a passive position and wait for the men to do the “heavy” work
-there is not such a thing that some tasks can be done by men only; for example, women are perfectly capable to drive or even repair a tractor
-always believe that it is ok to be a learner instead of a expert
-pushing yourself to the limit, start learning technical skills
-keep learning and be confident, you do not have to be an expert in order to become a farmer
-start a farm apprenticeship 

About Urban Adamah:
Urban Adamah is an educational farm and community center in Berkeley, California, that integrates the practices of Jewish tradition, sustainable agriculture, mindfulness and social action to build loving, just and sustainable communities. We provide educational programs and community celebrations for more than 5,000 visitors a year, as well as a residential fellowship program for young adults that combines organic farming, progressive Jewish living and social justice internships. Urban Adamah also offers innovative, farm-based programs for school-age children. Our organic farm produces a diverse yield of crops, all of which we donate to the local community through food banks and our weekly Free Farm Stand.

The Farm
The Urban Adamah farm is located on an lot at 1050 Parker Street in Berkeley, California. Our ever-growing farm campus includes two greenhouses, several teaching and program tents, an aquaponics system, a chicken coop, a worm composting operation, a goat pen and milking station, beehives and over one hundred raised garden beds.
Urban Adamah is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, and we grow our food as a labor of love to increase access to nutritious food and cultivate community. The tenets of permaculture guide all of our farming practices. On our one-acre urban farm, we produce approximately 12,000 lbs of organic produce a year, the majority of which we donate through our weekly Free Farm Stand and other community distributions.
Our farm site was made possible through a no-cost lease from Wareham Development LLC until the end of 2015. In Spring 2013, we launched a Capital Campaign to secure our organization a permanent home. In December 2013 we purchased a fabulous 2.2-acre lot in Northwest Berkeley. We are currently raising money to move our farm to the 6th Street Campus and hope to complete our move from Parker Street in December, 2015.
How We Grow
Our farm is cultivated by a full-time farm manager who oversees the work of the 12-14 young adults who participate in our three-month residential fellowship. From the fields to their social justice internships, fellows learn experientially about urban organic farming, food justice and progressive Jewish community. We also depend on the generosity of the many volunteers who help each week and month to make our farm thrive.


Coalition/organization member:
-Biodynamic
-Eco-farm conference every year



Willow’s Bio from Urban Adamah’s website
Willow Rosenthal grew up in West Sonoma County, where she began her love of farming by planting an annual veggie garden with her Dad. Since moving to the Bay Area in 1997, she has worked to strengthen local economies and improve community food access with a variety of organizations including the Women’s Initiative for Self Employment; Food First; the Organic Consumers Association; Berkeley Region Exchange and Development; and The West Oakland Neighborhood Improvement Initiative. In 2000 Willow founded City Slicker Farms, in order to increase access to fresh produce for low-income residents in her West Oakland neighborhood. She has partnered with Slow Food USA on the Victory Garden at San Francisco City Hall, and with the US Department of Labor on the urban farm at the Treasure Island Job Corps Center. She and Novella Carpenter are co-authors of The Essential Urban Farmer (Penguin Press, 2011). She holds a BA in International Studies from the University of Oregon, and is a certified Waldorf teacher. Willow is excited to now bring an understanding of human development to farm and garden education at Urban Adamah. She lives in Berkeley with her husband where they tend a very, very small veggie garden of their own.
